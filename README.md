#Sliding Puzzle wout UI

In a sliding puzzle, you are presented with numbers 1, 2, 3 (4, ... , 15) in a 
grid of 4 (16) spaces, with 3 (15) numbers in a random order and one empty space. 
To solve such a puzzle exchange the empty space with one of its neighbor 
numbers, to get the numbers displayed in order with the empty space at the end.

A brute force approach (no intelligence) with random choices of exchanges and 
an upper exchange limit of 10000 is used in this project.
